All the code for the project is run using the Makefile. Running make or make all will compile and run each of the code for each of the problems. You can also compile and run each problem seperately using for instance make p8 to run p8.

The c++ programs use cpp_utils, which is a folder outside of project1. This file is still in the repository, it is just in FYS4150 instead of FYS4150/project1

The makefile is autogenerated by the script smakefile.py, but this script does not need to be rerun as the Makefile is included in the repository.
