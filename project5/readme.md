# Project 5

All the code for the project is run using the Makefile. Running `make` or `make all` will compile and run the code for each of the problems. You can also compile and run each problem separately using for instance `make p5` to run problem 5. The python programs create svg files, so the script `svg2pdf.sh` is used to convert the svg files to pdf files that can be used with latex.

The makefile is autogenerated by the script `smakefile.py`, but this script does not need to be rerun as the Makefile is included in the repository.
