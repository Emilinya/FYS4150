# Project 2

All the code for the project is run using the Makefile. Running `make` or `make all` will compile and run the code for each of the problems. You can also compile and run each problem separately using for instance `make p3` to run problem 3.

The problem6 uses utils.hh, which is in the cpp_utils folder outside of project2. This file is still in the repository, it is just in FYS4150/cpp_utils instead of FYS4150/project2

The makefile is autogenerated by the script `smakefile.py`, but this script does not need to be rerun as the Makefile is included in the repository.
